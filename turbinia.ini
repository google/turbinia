description_short: Automation and Scaling of Digital Forensics Tools
description_long: Turbinia is an open-source framework for deploying, managing, and running
    forensic workloads on cloud platforms. It is intended to automate running
    of common forensic processing tools (i.e. Plaso, TSK, strings, etc) to
    help with processing evidence in the Cloud, scaling the processing of
    large amounts of evidence, and decreasing response time by parallelizing
    processing where possible.
