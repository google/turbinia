    cloud_only (bool): Set to True for evidence types that can only be processed
        in a cloud environment, e.g. GoogleCloudDisk.
    context_dependent (bool): Whether this evidence is required to be built upon
        the context of a parent evidence.

        True for object types that we want to copy to/from storage (e.g.
        PlasoFile, but not RawDisk).
    name (str): Name of evidence.

    saved_path (str): Path to secondary location evidence is saved for later
        retrieval (e.g. GCS).
    saved_path_type (str): The name of the output writer that saved evidence
        to the saved_path location.
    source (str): String indicating where evidence came from (including tool
        version that created it, if appropriate).
    local_path (str): Path to the processed data (can be a blockdevice or a
        mounted directory, etc).  This is the path that most Tasks should use to
        access evidence after it's been processed on the worker (i.e. when the
        Tasks `run()` method is called).  The last pre-processor to run should
        set this path.
    source_path (str): Path to the original un-processed source data for the
        Evidence.  This is the path that Evidence should be created and set up
        with initially.  Tasks should generally not use this path, but instead
        use the `local_path`.
    mount_path (str): Path to a mounted file system (if relevant).
    credentials (list): Decryption keys for encrypted evidence.
    tags (dict): Extra tags associated with this evidence.
    request_id (str): The id of the request this evidence came from, if any.
    has_child_evidence (bool): This property indicates the evidence object has
        child evidence.
    parent_evidence (Evidence): The Evidence object that was used to generate
        this one, and which pre/post process methods we need to re-execute to
        access data relevant to us.
    save_metadata (bool): Evidence with this property set will save a metadata
        file alongside the Evidence when saving to external storage.  The
        metadata file will contain all of the key=value pairs sent along with
        the processing request in the recipe.  The output is in JSON format
    state (dict): A map of each EvidenceState type to a boolean to indicate
        if that state is true.  This is used by the preprocessors to set the
        current state and Tasks can use this to determine if the Evidence is in
        the correct state for processing.

    This is a wrapper function that will call the chain of pre-processors

    the context of the local task execution on the worker nodes prior to the
    task itself running.  This can be used to prepare the evidence to be
    processed (e.g. attach a cloud disk, mount a local disk etc).

    Tasks export a list of the required_states they have for the state of the
    Evidence it can process in `TurbiniaTask.REQUIRED_STATES`[1].  Evidence also
    exports a list of the possible states it can have after pre/post-processing
    in `Evidence.POSSIBLE_STATES`.  The pre-processors should run selectively
    based on the these requirements that come from the Task, and the
    post-processors should run selectively based on the current state of the

    If a Task requires a given state supported by the given Evidence class, but
    it is not met after the preprocessing of the Evidence is run, then the Task
    will abort early.  Note that for compound evidence types that have parent
    Evidence objects (e.g. where `context_dependent` is True), we only inspect
    the child Evidence type for its state as it is assumed that it would only be
    able to run the appropriate pre/post-processors when the parent Evidence
    processors have been successful.

    [1] Note that the evidence states required by the Task are only required if
    the Evidence also supports that state in `POSSSIBLE_STATES`.  This is so
    that the Tasks are flexible enough to support multiple types of Evidence.
    For example, `PlasoTask` allows both `CompressedDirectory` and
    `GoogleCloudDisk` as Evidence input, and has states `ATTACHED` and
    `DECOMPRESSED` listed in `PlasoTask.REQUIRED_STATES`.  Since `ATTACHED`
    state is supported by `GoogleCloudDisk`, and `DECOMPRESSED` is supported by
    `CompressedDirectory`, only those respective pre-processors will be run and
    the state is confirmed after the preprocessing is complete.
