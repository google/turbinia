# Debugging

## Logs

There are a few different logs that may be useful when debugging:

*   Server log: By default this is on the server in 
    `OUTPUT_DIR/turbinia-server.log`
*   Worker logs: By default this is on the workers in
    `OUTPUT_DIR/turbinia-worker.log`
*   Task logs: These are logs that are generated by a Task running in the
    Worker. If you have GCS enabled, then these logs are saved there, and
    in either case, the paths can be determined with
    `turbiniactl -a status` (note that -a is required to show all data
    associated with the tasks).
*   Task execution logs. These are the logs that are generated by binaries
    executed from a Task. For example, Plaso generates its own log file, and
    that gets saved by the Task. As with the Task logs, these can be stored in
    GCS and retrieved with `gsutil`.
*   If you have `STACKDRIVER_LOGGING` and/or `STACKDRIVER_TRACEBACK` enabled
    in the config, the logs and/or traceback exceptions will also be logged into
    stackdriver in same project that Turbinia is configured to run in.

## Request Debugging

### Finding previous request data
By default `turbiniactl` will make a processing request and immediately return.
It will print out the request ID when it makes the request, and you can use this to
see the current status of the request with `turbiniactl status -r <request id>`.  If
you specify the `-w` flag (`turbiniactl -w status -r <request id>`), the client will
wait for all Tasks to complete and then return.  Killing the client will not affect
the processing, and you can resume waiting for the task results with the same command.

If you do not have your request ID, you can list all recent requests like this:
```
$ turbiniactl status -i

# Turbinia report for Requests made within 7 days
* 2 requests were made within this timeframe.

## Request ID: 5198949e3fdb8dk569de1268000f97d8
* Last Update: 2021-02-10T08:39:27.446000Z
* Requester: turbiniauser
* Task Count: 441

## Request ID: 69de1268000f97d85198949e3fdb8dk5

* Requester: turbiniauser
* Task Count: 43
```

### No Jobs being created

If you create a processing request with `turbiniactl` and the client just
hangs at the message `Tasks completed (0/0): [], waiting for [].`, it's
possible that there was either a problem with the request getting to the
server, or the server may have crashed. In this case take a look at the
server logs to see if the server accepted the request (you can grep for
the request ID which should be in the client output) and note any log
messages around this point.  If there was a crash of the server, there may
be relevant log messages prior to the crash that are useful in determining
the cause.  If there are server crashes or other problems processing or
validating a request, please file a Github Issue with the relevant details.

## Task Debugging

### Task Failures

The following is an example of debugging a task failure:

Running turbiniactl, we see a failure of the PsortTask (`-d1` specifies history
for the last day):

```
$ ./turbiniactl status -d1

Retrieved 2 Task results:
2017-12-06T15:09:15.013Z PsortTask Failed: Execution failed with status 1
2017-12-06T15:08:49.616Z PlasoTask Successful: Completed successfully in 0:00:14.178579 on aaronp.dev
```

We can specify `-a` to get all info we have about that Task, and this
will include the request Id, Task Id, and the other logs associated with
the task.

```
$ ./turbiniactl -a status -d1

Retrieved 2 Task results:
2017-12-06T15:09:15.013Z request: None task: 1f8c4b321f444614bde296b0a00bb91f PsortTask Failed: Execution failed with status 1
        gs://my-turbinia-bucket/output/1512601742-1f8c4b321f444614bde296b0a00bb91f-PsortTask/worker-log.txt
2017-12-06T15:08:49.616Z request: b94ad420cf5a483fb3fc4409d5fc6dcd task: 020fe728a2b64dc7ba1da2656e1cc454 PlasoTask Successful: Completed successfully in 0:00:14.178579 on aaronp.dev
        gs://my-turbinia-bucket/output/1512601704-020fe728a2b64dc7ba1da2656e1cc454-PlasoTask/020fe728a2b64dc7ba1da2656e1cc454.log
        gs://my-turbinia-bucket/output/1512601704-020fe728a2b64dc7ba1da2656e1cc454-PlasoTask/worker-log.txt
```

Note that there may be local paths that show up in the
`turbiniactl status` output, and these are local to the Worker that
executed that Task.

Using the saved paths above we can display the output with `gsutil`.

```
$ gsutil cat gs://my-turbinia-bucket/output/1512601742-1f8c4b321f444614bde296b0a00bb91f-PsortTask/worker-log.txt

Running psort as [psort.py --status_view none --logfile /var/tmp/1512601742-1f8c4b321f444614bde296b0a00bb91f-PsortTask/1f8c4b321f444614bde296b0a00bb91f.log -w /var/tmp/1512601742-1f8c4b321f444614bde296b0a00bb91f-PsortTask/1f8c4b321f444614bde296b0a00bb91f.csv /var/tmp/1512601730-b04f479ef9094954968474431aa30e8a-PsortTask/b04f479ef9094954968474431aa30e8a.csv]
Execution failed with status 1
```

### Full Task report data
To see the report output along with the request status you can specify
`-R` similar to: `turbiniactl status -R -r <request id>`.  By default
this output will be filtered to only show high priority Task report
output (as determined by the Task at runtime) in order to filter out
uninteresting report info.  You can specify `-p <prio num>` to set
what priority you want to show in the output report.  To see all report
output you can specify `-p 100`.  To also show all saved files you can
specify `-a`.  Putting these together will show all output and can be
quite a large amount of data: `turbiniactl -a status -r <request id> -R -p 100`.

### Determining Task status
If you want to get a view of the total running Tasks, you can specify
`turbiniactl status -w` to see what Tasks are running or queued on
each of the Workers.  If you want to see all of the completed Tasks,
you can also specify `-a` to include them: `turbiniactl -a status -w`.


### Writing debug logs for binary dependencies
Some Turbinia tasks execute binaries that can also write their own
debug logs as part of execution.  This can be expensive so it is
turned off by default.  You can specify `-T` during the request
to enable these logs temporarily per-request  (e.g.
`turbiniactl -T googleclouddisk -d disk-to-process`). Alternately
you can set `DEBUG_TASKS = True` in the config file for the Worker.

### Disappearing Tasks

If the Turbinia server is scheduling Tasks, but you're not seeing the
Tasks or their output for some reason, the most common scenario is that
either a second Turbinia server or a second set of Workers is running
and operating on the same PubSub queues.  Make sure that you have unique
values per each Turbinia instance for the following config variables:
`PSQ_TOPIC`, `INSTANCE_ID`, `PUBSUB_TOPIC` and `KOMBU_CHANNEL` (if you
are using a local Turbinia installation type.

## Common Errors

*   If you encounter a cycle of errors on the Turbinia server when decoding
    specific malformed pubsub messages, and the failure happens prior to the
    server acknowledging the pubsub message, you may need to manually clear the
    pubsub queue. If you are sure there aren't other outstanding requests, you
    can just pull and auto-ack the existing messages, otherwise you may need a
    variation of this command to selectively ack messages:

```
gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions pull --auto-ack $my-pubsub-subscription-name
```
