# Turbinia

## Summary

Turbinia is an open-source framework for deploying, managing, and running
distributed forensic workloads. It is intended to automate running of common
forensic processing tools (i.e. Plaso, TSK, strings, etc) to help with
processing evidence in the Cloud, scaling the processing of large amounts of
evidence, and decreasing response time by parallelizing processing where
possible.

## How it works

Turbinia is composed of different components for the client, server and the
workers. These components can be run in the Cloud, on local machines, or as a
hybrid of both. The Turbinia client makes requests to process evidence to the
Turbinia server. The Turbinia server creates logical jobs from these incoming
user requests, which creates and schedules forensic processing tasks to be run
by the workers. The evidence to be processed will be split up by the jobs when
possible, and many tasks can be created in order to process the evidence in
parallel. One or more workers run continuously to process tasks from the server.
Any new evidence created or discovered by the tasks will be fed back into
Turbinia for further processing.

Communication from the client to the server is currently done with either Google
Cloud PubSub or [Kombu](https://github.com/celery/kombu) messaging. The worker
implementation can use either [PSQ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/psq)
(a Google Cloud PubSub Task Queue) or [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/)
for task scheduling.

The main documentation for Turbinia can be
[found here](https://turbinia.readthedocs.io/). You can also find out more about
the architecture and
[how it works here](https://turbinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/how-it-works.html).

## Status

Turbinia is currently in Alpha release.

## Installation

There is an
[installation guide here](https://turbinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html).

## Usage

The basic steps to get things running after the initial installation and
configuration are:

*   Start Turbinia server component with `turbiniactl server` command
*   Start one or more Turbinia workers with `turbiniactl psqworker`
*   Send evidence to be processed from the turbinia client with `turbiniactl
    ${evidencetype}`
*   Check status of running tasks with `turbiniactl status`

turbiniactl can be used to start the different components, and here is the basic
usage:

```
$ turbiniactl -h
usage: turbiniactl [-h] [-q] [-v] [-d] [-a] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-C RECIPE_CONFIG]
                   [-f] [-k DECRYPTION_KEYS] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-L LOG_FILE]
                   [-r REQUEST_ID] [-R] [-V] [-D] [-F FILTER_PATTERNS_FILE]
                   [-Y YARA_RULES_FILE] [-j JOBS_ALLOWLIST] [-J JOBS_DENYLIST]
                   [-p POLL_INTERVAL] [-t TASK] [-T] [-w]
                   <command> ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet           Show minimal output
  -v, --verbose         Show verbose output

  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config_file CONFIG_FILE
                        Load explicit config file. If specified it will ignore
                        config files in other default locations
                        (/etc/turbinia.conf, ~/.turbiniarc, or in paths
                        referenced in environment variable TURBINIA_CONFIG_PATH)
  -C RECIPE_CONFIG, --recipe_config RECIPE_CONFIG
                        Recipe configuration data passed in as comma separated
                        key=value pairs (e.g. "-C
                        key=value,otherkey=othervalue"). These will get passed
                        to tasks as evidence config, and will also be written to
                        the metadata.json file for Evidence types that write it
  -f, --force_evidence  Force evidence processing request in potentially unsafe
                        conditions
  -k DECRYPTION_KEYS, --decryption_keys DECRYPTION_KEYS
                        Decryption keys to be passed in as comma separated list.
                        Each entry should be in the form type=key. (e.g. "-k
                        password=123456,recovery_password=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX")
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory path for output
  -L LOG_FILE, --log_file LOG_FILE
                        Log file
  -r REQUEST_ID, --request_id REQUEST_ID
                        Create new requests with this Request ID
  -V, --version         Show the version
  -D, --dump_json       Dump JSON output of Turbinia Request instead of sending
                        it
  -F FILTER_PATTERNS_FILE, --filter_patterns_file FILTER_PATTERNS_FILE
                        A file containing newline separated string patterns to
                        filter text based evidence files with (in extended grep
                        regex format). This filtered output will be in addition
                        to the complete output
  -Y YARA_RULES_FILE, --yara_rules_file YARA_RULES_FILE
                        A file containing Yara rules.
  -j JOBS_ALLOWLIST, --jobs_allowlist JOBS_ALLOWLIST
                        An allowlist for Jobs that will be allowed to run (in
                        CSV format, no spaces). This will not force them to run
                        if they are not configured to. This is applied both at
                        server start time and when the client makes a processing
                        request. When applied at server start time the change is
                        persistent while the server is running. When applied by
                        the client, it will only affect that processing request.
  -J JOBS_DENYLIST, --jobs_denylist JOBS_DENYLIST
                        A denylist for Jobs we will not allow to run. See
                        --jobs_allowlist help for details on format and when it
                        is applied.
  -p POLL_INTERVAL, --poll_interval POLL_INTERVAL
                        Number of seconds to wait between polling for task state
                        info
  -T, --debug_tasks     Show debug output for all supported tasks
  -w, --wait            Wait to exit until all tasks for the given request have
                        completed

The commands for processing evidence specify the metadata about that evidence
for Turbinia to process. By default, when adding new evidence to be processed,
turbiniactl will act as a client and send a request to the configured Turbinia
server, otherwise if `server` is specified, it will start up its own Turbinia
server process. Here's the turbiniactl usage for adding a raw disk type of
evidence to be processed by Turbinia:

```
$ turbiniactl rawdisk -h
usage: turbiniactl rawdisk [-h] -l SOURCE_PATH [-P MOUNT_PARTITION]
                           [-s SOURCE] [-n NAME]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l SOURCE_PATH, --source_path SOURCE_PATH
                        Local path to the evidence
  -P MOUNT_PARTITION, --mount_partition MOUNT_PARTITION
                        The partition number to use when mounting this disk.
                        Defaults to the entire raw disk. Only affects
                        mounting, and not what gets processed.
  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                        Description of the source of the evidence
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Descriptive name of the evidence
```

Sample rawdisk command:
`turbiniactl rawdisk -l {PATH_TO_THE_IMAGE}`

Status information about the requests that are being or have been processed can
be viewed with the `turbiniactl status` command. You can specify the request ID
that was generated, or other filters like the username of the requester, or how
many days of processing history you want to view. You can also generate
statistics and reports (in markdown format) with other flags.

```
$ turbiniactl status -h
usage: turbiniactl status [-h] [-c] [-C] [-d DAYS_HISTORY] [-f]
                          [-r REQUEST_ID] [-p PRIORITY_FILTER] [-R] [-s]
                          [-t TASK_ID] [-u USER] [-i] [-w]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --close_tasks     Close tasks based on Request ID or Task ID
  -C, --csv             When used with --statistics, the output will be in CSV
                        format
  -d DAYS_HISTORY, --days_history DAYS_HISTORY
                        Number of days of history to show
  -f, --force           Gatekeeper for --close_tasks
  -r REQUEST_ID, --request_id REQUEST_ID
                        Show tasks with this Request ID
  -p PRIORITY_FILTER, --priority_filter PRIORITY_FILTER
                        This sets what report sections are shown in full
                        detail in report output. Any tasks that have set a
                        report_priority value equal to or lower than this
                        setting will be shown in full detail, and tasks with a
                        higher value will only have a summary shown. To see
                        all tasks report output in full detail, set
                        --priority_filter=100

                        default timeframe is 7 days. Please use the -d flag to
                        extend this.
  -w, --workers         Show Worker status information from a specified
                        timeframe. The default timeframe is 7 days. Please use
                        the -d flag to extend this.
```
Sample status command:
`turbiniactl -a status -r {REQUEST_ID}`
